      <description>This is a blog dedicated to thoughts I have about technology and things I learn.
I currently work in the Health Care IT industry, mainly doing backend server support providing tools for other teams to make their jobs and lives easier. Some of these tools include Chef, Splunk or Elastic Stack, Zabbix, Jenkins, and RunDeck. I also do a lot of work in Amazon AWS, and dabble with Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean, and OpenStack I do not perscribe to the title DevOps anything.</description>

      <title>Learning Ruby Path</title>

      <description>This was originally written in a Google Drive Document that was shared with a few people. However, I feel that it is time I &amp;ldquo;released&amp;rdquo; the document and shared it with anyone who wanted to learn Ruby the way I feel it should be learned.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a tutorial like other sites, but more of a learning path, or guide to which documents, and ideas you should learn first.</description>
