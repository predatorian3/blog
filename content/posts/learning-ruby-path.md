This was originally written in a Google Drive Document that was shared with a few people. However, I feel that it is time I "released" the document and shared it with anyone who wanted to learn Ruby the way I feel it should be learned. 

This isn't going to be a tutorial like other sites, but more of a learning path, or guide to which documents, and ideas you should learn first. If I had something like this when I was first beginning to learn Ruby, I would've seen the goal, and known what to use in some of my projects. This is a little biased, but, hey, I wrote this. 

# Learning Ruby by Phil

First, while starting out, you should know where to get help, not necessarily answers. My favorite place to go for help is IRC, specifically Freenode. The #ruby channel and the community are pretty helpful. I will caution that before you make posts in the channel, you should learn how to ask your question, and be sure you exhausted all other options such as Googling, or web searching, books, looking at other people's code and asking those around you. 

[Freenode's WebChat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ruby%2C%23ruby-community%2C%23ruby-offtopic&uio=d4) is the place get quick access to IRC without having a client on your system.
