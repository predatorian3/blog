This is a blog dedicated to thoughts I have about technology and things I learn. 

I currently work in the Health Care IT industry, mainly doing backend server support providing tools for other teams to make their jobs and lives easier. Some of these tools include [Chef](), [Splunk]() or [Elastic Stack](), [Zabbix](), [Jenkins](), and [RunDeck](). I do not perscribe to the title DevOps anything. I just firmly believe any IT, or Systems person should know the basics of Scripting or Development, and how to setup tools they want to use to enable them to do better things. 

I started out as a hobby IT person doing work as a kid for my parents, and relatives. My father brought home our first PC from his work, and it was a Packard Bell something-or-other. It didn't do much but make cards, CD inserts, and open Lotus. From there, we invested in a newer PC with a 200mb hard drive. Then I went dumpster diving behind my school and found a bunch of parts they were getting rid of. My friend and I put the PC together, and it magically turned on. Now, how to make it do stuff we thought. That's when I learned of Ubuntu Linux, and got a few dozen CD's from them in the mail. Exciting times! However, games wouldn't play on it that I wanted, and I heard of something called XP. So, like every other kid I knew, I found a cracked version, and used it. Eventually I earned the money to buy Vista, then 8, and now 10. However, I use that only for gaming, and do all my other work, and processing on Linux, be it Ubuntu, Fedora, ArchLinux, or Raspian. 

At the office, I had to fight to get a MacBook with OSX, which was the closest I could get to having a native shell that wasn't some tack on WSL, or Cygwin, or running a VM on my Windows laptop at work. Finding Windows ports for devleopment tools that weren't Windows focused was a task in itself. Go, Ruby, Python, C/C++, I wanted to rip my hair out by the amount of ridiculous stuff I had to have to do a single task. 

Either way, this is me, and my blog. Please bookmark it.
