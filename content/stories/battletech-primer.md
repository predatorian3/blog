Its a gritty univrse where people are pit against people in tons of twisted metal shooting at someone else in a twistd heap of metal. That's the basics of the universe, the BattleMech. There's a whole deeper, richer part of the cultures, the politics, the companies, and just planets in the known Battletech universe.
