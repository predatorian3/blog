      <title>Learning Ruby Path</title>

      <description>This was originally written in a Google Drive Document that was shared with a few people. However, I feel that it is time I &amp;ldquo;released&amp;rdquo; the document and shared it with anyone who wanted to learn Ruby the way I feel it should be learned.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a tutorial like other sites, but more of a learning path, or guide to which documents, and ideas you should learn first.</description>
