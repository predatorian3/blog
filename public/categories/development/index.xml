      <description>This is something that baffled me for a long while because when I would learn about Python, I would just end up with a ton of .py files all over that were named something stupid. Then whn it came to wanting to distribute my Python script with its dependencies, I had no idea how to do it, and forced my users to download their dependencies by hand. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a how-to on how to do Python Packaging, but its an easy way to get started, and learning on your own.</description>
