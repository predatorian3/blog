      <description>Python Module Packaging This is something that baffled me for a long while because when I would learn about Python, I would just end up with a ton of .py files all over that were named something stupid. Then whn it came to wanting to distribute my Python script with its dependencies, I had no idea how to do it, and forced my users to download their dependencies by hand.</description>

      <title>Learning Ruby Path</title>

      <description>This was originally written in a Google Drive Document that was shared with a few people. However, I feel that it is time I &amp;ldquo;released&amp;rdquo; the document and shared it with anyone who wanted to learn Ruby the way I feel it should be learned.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a tutorial like other sites, but more of a learning path, or guide to which documents, and ideas you should learn first.</description>
